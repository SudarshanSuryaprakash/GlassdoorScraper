Bringing Ingenuity to Life

We’re an innovation and transformation consultancy that believes in the power of ingenuity to build a positive-human future in a technology-driven world. Our diverse teams of experts combine innovative thinking with breakthrough-technologies to progress further, faster.

Those that start using AI and advanced data analytics early will gain the most. While the technology is yet to live up to the hype, using it now gives a chance to get ahead, learn and improve to drive long-term value.

It’s essential to start with developing and deploying use cases and meanwhile building a capability around artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced data analytics. It’ll be a key differentiator in the short term, and a necessity in the long term.

Data Architects - We’re experts in uncovering the real story buried in data. We are looking for data architects who know how the future data platforms look like and know how they interact with existing legacy clients’ architecture.
In recent projects our team have:
Analysed the blogosphere to identify influencers
Used voice and text analytics to predict customer sentiments and Net Promotor Scores
Created an internet of things trial for a FTSE 100 company
Used unstructured data to predict breaches in ethical behaviour of global organisations
Used deep learning to uncover optimal settings to make a pharmaceutical manufacturing process 15% more efficient
Analysed live audio data to create individual sound zones
Used neural networks to detect patterns in massive highly non-linear time-series.
Who do we want?
A degree, Masters or PhD from a leading university in mathematics, operational research, physics, finance and economics or computer science.
A genuine affinity for problem solving - an inquisitive mind who wants to solve the trickiest challenges whilst working with incredible colleagues.
Existing experience in consulting would be beneficial although we equally like in-house experience
Experience of conducting analysis for evidence based decision making, developing models and decision support tools or building business cases for investment decisions.
We work independently of any particular platform so we can provide unbiased client advice and choose the best approach for our clients
Existing experience in consulting would be beneficial although we equally like in-house experience

ProFinda
Headquarters: London, UK
https://profinda.com

ProFinda is a software company pioneering “Workforce Optimisation”. This emerging £2.8bn software category will transform organisational productivity and the employee talent agenda. With our unique technology, our global clients and channel partnerships we are entering a massively exciting growth phase.

ProFinda is headquartered in London. Since going live in 2011, ProFinda has become an award-winning enterprise technology solution with a focus on professional services and other knowledge-driven industries.

These organisations have been spending millions on talent systems that haven’t given them the information they need about their own employee’s skills, let alone their total talent pool including contingent and alumni workers. As a result, employees are left unengaged and under-utilised while these organisations spend more money sourcing contingent workers to fill the gap, and not necessarily the right ones.

ProFinda is a workforce optimisation platform that maps the skills, knowledge, and expertise available across an organisation's total talent supply chain of internal, contingent and alumni workers.

By implementing ProFinda a company can now far better match their available talent internally and externally with the right opportunities at the right time, increasing engagement, productivity, and efficiency while decreasing costs. We use our proprietary skills ontology and machine learning to build an accurate knowledge base of the skills and experiences of employees, contractors, and alumni for major enterprises.

We believe we are changing the way companies think about their people and the way people think about their own careers, by making the total talent pool a reality. To take customers on this journey we need to win their confidence, excel at delivery and continually delight them as the product grows and changes. We treat each client like they were our first and want to find people who are as passionate as we are about client’s successes.

What we are looking for

We're looking for a Data Scientist with 5 or more years of demonstrable experience to work with our Intelligence team on building a semantic, local-grammar based system.

This is a full time role and we would expect the successful candidate to spend at least two days a week in the London Office with the option to work from home on the other days.

As part of your role you will be able to architect and solve complex problems with the best tools you can find. You will research and develop Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning algorithms, along with existing libraries usage and will be responsible for new ways of data usage discovery. You will also assist in product development, looking at things from a data perspective and be responsible for key textual data problems, suggestions and deep search.

Skills & Requirements:

· An experience with advanced application architectures (5+ years)

· Experience working with UniTex

· Keen interest in cutting-edge ML/NLP solutions and technologies

· Experience with Ruby, Python or Java will help but we can help you learn these if your experience in another language is good

· Experience with AWS services

· Knowledge of search systems (like Elasticsearch)

· The ability to quickly mockup a solution using one of common ML/NLP libraries (like OpenNLP, Gensim, NLTK and so on)

· An ability to draft a service for subsequent usage by other team members

· Strong Database knowledge (relational, non-relational and graph)

· Familiarity with using REST APIs

· Good writing skills, with a passion for documenting

· Excellent knowledge of English (spoken and written)

· Work in an agile team

· Understand the structure of existing applications and how to work with them

43,Data Science Software Engineer,-1,"We are looking for experienced software engineers with proven track record in data science to work on client sites in the London areas. We have a wide range of opportunities in this area so your role will vary depending on your existing experience, our customer needs and your aspirations. This role will expand your abilities through working alongside our wealth of specialist data scientists and software engineers on various projects, from rapidly prototyped research right through to high grade enterprise systems.

Roke delivers advanced research, development services and products and is a vendor neutral supplier picking the most appropriate technologies to achieve the required performance and capabilities. Roke staffs its teams with the most appropriate individuals, although it’s rare to have nothing new to learn on a project so an enthusiasm to learn and adapt to new technical challenges is vital for this role.

Many of our projects are highly creative, so we are looking for individuals who have the ability to think around and propose solutions to problems. All our data scientists need to communicate to a high standard and work effectively in multi-skilled teams, so good written and verbal communication skills are fundamental.

Applicants who would prefer more flexible working arrangements, such as reduced hours, would be welcome to apply for this role.

What will your role look like?

You will be developing data science solutions within one or more of our client side teams. If you have the experience, you could also provide technical leadership to junior members of staff and interact with stakeholders during the development cycle.

Our data analytics work encompasses all types of data, including structured and unstructured data (such as text and image). Projects vary greatly depending on the customer and their requirements. We use a variety of software, picking the best approach to suit the customers’ needs. For example, you might exploit your software expertise to solve big data or data streaming challenges using open source technologies. Alternatively, you might use your statistical background to develop machine learned models to classify data. Or, perhaps you will specialise in data visualisation techniques in order to enable our customers to easily access the required information from their data.

Most projects will require some data cleansing and transformation, so you should be comfortable with standard data pre-processing techniques.

Location can vary and should your role require you to attend client sites, you will be encouraged to spend a proportion of your time at our Roke base site (London) contributing to the Rokes technical innovation and data science community.

What do we need from you?

You will ideally hold a degree qualification in computer science, software engineering, data science, mathematics, physics or similar. Alternatively you will have similar experience/education to an equivalent level. You will be an enthusiastic software engineer and will also have experience of multiple programming languages with a passion for high-quality, eligible and maintainable code.

You will have data science expertise; however, as this is such a broad area we would consider experience in a subset of any of the following:
Large scale (‘big data’) data ecosystems, cloud infrastructure and analytic frameworks.
Machine learning and Deep Neural Net technologies
Techniques and toolkits for data cleansing, data preparation, data processing, fusion and analysis
Techniques and toolkits for combining data or analysing data streams in real time
Programming languages and techniques for visualising data
You will be comfortable working side by side with product managers, designers, and clients, making decisions together in order to quickly deliver valuable working software to clients and their users.

You enjoy growing your skills and those of your team and you regularly learn about new technologies. Most importantly, you judge your achievements by the success and happiness of your team and its customers.

As an effective communicator you will have experience consulting or teaching and enjoy mentoring junior developers, helping them push their boundaries and abilities. You value transparency and continuous improvement in your development team.

Roke also operates in the fields of network communications, network connectivity, autonomy and cyber and your familiarity with underpinning concepts in one or more of these areas would be beneficial.

Why should you work with us?

We offer you a competitive salary and benefits package including:
A substantial performance related bonus scheme, which we accompany with a clearly defined and fair review process.
25 days holiday per annum with the option to accrue up to a further 8 days flexi-leave.
Company funded private medical insurance, for you and your family, in addition to a contributory pension that will allow you to effectively save for the future.

Whatever we do, wherever we are in the world, we lead the way, serve with integrity, take care of each other, foster inclusion, and collaborate for maximum impact. These five shared values lead every decision we make and action we take, guiding us to deliver impact how and where it matters most.

Being a Leader at Deloitte
Cultural fit and purpose-led leadership is crucial for Deloitte. Our leaders always set the example and inspire their colleagues. They make quality time for people and take an interest in them. They know what matters to people - both inside and outside work – and value them as individuals; always finding opportunities to develop them while showing respect and appreciation.
We expect colleagues at all levels to embrace and live our purpose and our leadership culture by challenging themselves to identify issues that are most important for our clients, our people, and for society and make an impact that matters. We know leadership comes in all shapes and sizes, but our Leadership Charter helps all of our people understand what we’re looking for:
We live our purpose: we act as a role model, embracing and living our purpose and values, and recognising others for the impact they make
We develop talent: we develop high-performing people and teams through challenging and meaningful opportunities
We drive performance: we deliver exceptional client service; maximise results and drive high performance from people while fostering collaboration across businesses and borders
We believe positive influence can make an impact that matters: we influence clients, teams, and individuals positively, leading by example and establishing confident relationships with increasingly senior people
We move, together, towards a strategic direction: we understand key objectives for clients and Deloitte, aligning people to objectives and setting priorities and direction. Tax SLTAXC

We’re looking for a Data Scientist with 2-5 years of experience who wants to be part of a scaling company that prioritizes accessing and distributing data, and enables clients to focus on working with their data rather than for it.

What you will be doing:
Conducting research to identify data sources and data products for specific projects – both in the wild and on Namara
Building scripts to connect to some of these data sources
Wrangling and analyzing existing datasets for specific projects
Creating visualizations or otherwise packaging datasets for specific projects, both client-facing and internal for marketing/sales support
Liaising directly with clients on matters of data structure and ideal delivery
QAing datasets

What you bring:
Our ideal candidate wants to be part of a team that solves real-world problems and propels the next wave of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. You are tenacious and enjoy solving problems – be it development, data wrangling, or data analysis.

You are proficient in one or more of Python, Ruby, and R
You understand basic statistical concepts
You are familiar with data wrangling libraries and tools like Python Pandas, Open Refine, etc.
You are familiar with one or more data visualization tools like Tableau, Excel, Power BI etc.
You are able to quickly learn new tools and software
You are able to work both solo and collaboratively
You are able to communicate effectively with clients

What’s in it for you:
Knowledge. You will be given the tools and the support you need – from everyone on our Data, Engineering, and Leadership teams – to succeed in your role.
The chance to make an impact. We want someone who is creative and motivated to build and maintain customized data solutions for our clients. You’ll be working on the front-lines of data, delivering solutions directly to our clients, with real ownership over your projects.
Access to new tech. At ThinkData we don’t shy away from bleeding edge technology. We encourage you to experiment, test, and push the boundaries through research and development.
Career growth. This role will change and evolve as we continue to grow. We want you to be able to carve out your own career path here. The landscape is being built under our feet as we move forward, so we are on the lookout for people who can channel their passion, learn quickly and navigate the unknown at top speed.
Be a culture vulture. London is an incredible place – let’s make the most of it! Maybe you know the best spot for kebab, or maybe the West End is calling your name. We want to foster a culture where we’re serious about work and just as serious about having fun. Whether you’re a local expert or a brand new expat, be open to taking in what this city has to offer.
About Us
ThinkData Works, Inc. is a Toronto-based technology startup whose data management platform, Namara, is used by some of the foremost organizations in the world to process and refine data into usable products. We host one of the largest repositories of publicly available data and enable our clients to significantly increase the amount of information they use to fuel solutions.

At ThinkData, our mission is to build the easiest and most secure solution that enables our users to access, integrate, and collaborate on the data that powers their business. Some of the largest companies in the world, from tech to banking and beyond, use our platform.

We’re not a single-solution AI company or a consulting firm disguised as a startup. We’re interested in solving the fundamental problem of accessing and distributing data. Namara, as a data management platform, will propel the next wave of intelligent solutions.

Need more reasons to join?

We may be technologically driven, but like every Canadian, we know the best ideas are thought of in a cottage outside of Toronto. During the summer, we take the whole team on a 3-day retreat for vision-setting, aligning our goals, product management, and team-building. We’re not saying this involves beers, guitars, and songs by the campfire. But we’re not saying it doesn’t.

We are managing our growth. We continue to promote and nurture the open, collaborative nature of who we are and how we work. We work hard while still having fun, being ourselves, hanging out together, and enjoying delicious snacks at the office.

We want to foster a culture where we’re serious about work and just as serious about having fun. Whether you’re a local expert or a brand new expat, be open to taking in what this city has to offer.

Wrangling and analyzing existing datasets for specific projects
Creating visualizations or otherwise packaging datasets for specific projects, both client-facing and internal for marketing/sales support
Liaising directly with clients on matters of data structure and ideal delivery
QAing datasets

Our ideal candidate wants to be part of a team that solves real-world problems and propels the next wave of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. You are tenacious and enjoy solving problems – be it development, data wrangling, or data analysis.

You are proficient in one or more of Python, Ruby, and R

You are familiar with one or more data visualization tools like Tableau, Excel, Power BI etc.

The chance to make an impact. We want someone who is creative and motivated to build and maintain customized data solutions for our clients. You’ll be working on the front-lines of data, delivering solutions directly to our clients, with real ownership over your projects.
Access to new tech. At ThinkData we don’t shy away from bleeding edge technology. We encourage you to experiment, test, and push the boundaries through research and development.
Career growth. This role will change and evolve as we continue to grow. We want you to be able to carve out your own career path here. The landscape is being built under our feet as we move forward, so we are on the lookout for people who can channel their passion, learn quickly and navigate the unknown at top speed.
Be a culture vulture. London is an incredible place – let’s make the most of it! Maybe you know the best spot for kebab, or maybe the West End is calling your name. We want to foster a culture where we’re serious about work and just as serious about having fun. Whether you’re a local expert or a brand new expat, be open to taking in what this city has to offer.
About Us
ThinkData Works, Inc. is a Toronto-based technology startup whose data management platform, Namara, is used by some of the foremost organizations in the world to process and refine data into usable products. We host one of the largest repositories of publicly available data and enable our clients to significantly increase the amount of information they use to fuel solutions.

At ThinkData, our mission is to build the easiest and most secure solution that enables our users to access, integrate, and collaborate on the data that powers their business. Some of the largest companies in the world, from tech to banking and beyond, use our platform.

Need more reasons to join?

We may be technologically driven, but like every Canadian, we know the best ideas are thought of in a cottage outside of Toronto. During the summer, we take the whole team on a 3-day retreat for vision-setting, aligning our goals, product management, and team-building. We’re not saying this involves beers, guitars, and songs by the campfire. But we’re not saying it doesn’t.

We are managing our growth. We continue to promote and nurture the open, collaborative nature of who we are and how we work. We work hard while still having fun, being ourselves, hanging out together, and enjoying delicious snacks at the office.

We’re looking for a Data Scientist with 2-5 years of experience who wants to be part of a scaling company that prioritizes accessing and distributing data, and enables clients to focus on working with their data rather than for it.

What you will be doing:
Conducting research to identify data sources and data products for specific projects – both in the wild and on Namara
Building scripts to connect to some of these data sources
Wrangling and analyzing existing datasets for specific projects
Creating visualizations or otherwise packaging datasets for specific projects, both client-facing and internal for marketing/sales support
Liaising directly with clients on matters of data structure and ideal delivery
QAing datasets

What you bring:
Our ideal candidate wants to be part of a team that solves real-world problems and propels the next wave of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. You are tenacious and enjoy solving problems – be it development, data wrangling, or data analysis.

You are proficient in one or more of Python, Ruby, and R
You understand basic statistical concepts
You are familiar with data wrangling libraries and tools like Python Pandas, Open Refine, etc.
You are familiar with one or more data visualization tools like Tableau, Excel, Power BI etc.
You are able to quickly learn new tools and software
You are able to work both solo and collaboratively
You are able to communicate effectively with clients

What’s in it for you:
Knowledge. You will be given the tools and the support you need – from everyone on our Data, Engineering, and Leadership teams – to succeed in your role.
The chance to make an impact. We want someone who is creative and motivated to build and maintain customized data solutions for our clients. You’ll be working on the front-lines of data, delivering solutions directly to our clients, with real ownership over your projects.
Access to new tech. At ThinkData we don’t shy away from bleeding edge technology. We encourage you to experiment, test, and push the boundaries through research and development.
Career growth. This role will change and evolve as we continue to grow. We want you to be able to carve out your own career path here. The landscape is being built under our feet as we move forward, so we are on the lookout for people who can channel their passion, learn quickly and navigate the unknown at top speed.
Be a culture vulture. London is an incredible place – let’s make the most of it! Maybe you know the best spot for kebab, or maybe the West End is calling your name. We want to foster a culture where we’re serious about work and just as serious about having fun. Whether you’re a local expert or a brand new expat, be open to taking in what this city has to offer.
About Us
ThinkData Works, Inc. is a Toronto-based technology startup whose data management platform, Namara, is used by some of the foremost organizations in the world to process and refine data into usable products. We host one of the largest repositories of publicly available data and enable our clients to significantly increase the amount of information they use to fuel solutions.

At ThinkData, our mission is to build the easiest and most secure solution that enables our users to access, integrate, and collaborate on the data that powers their business. Some of the largest companies in the world, from tech to banking and beyond, use our platform.

We’re not a single-solution AI company or a consulting firm disguised as a startup. We’re interested in solving the fundamental problem of accessing and distributing data. Namara, as a data management platform, will propel the next wave of intelligent solutions.

Need more reasons to join?

We may be technologically driven, but like every Canadian, we know the best ideas are thought of in a cottage outside of Toronto. During the summer, we take the whole team on a 3-day retreat for vision-setting, aligning our goals, product management, and team-building. We’re not saying this involves beers, guitars, and songs by the campfire. But we’re not saying it doesn’t.

We are managing our growth. We continue to promote and nurture the open, collaborative nature of who we are and how we work. We work hard while still having fun, being ourselves, hanging out together, and enjoying delicious snacks at the office.

Get involved in the early stages to help us shape the vision and the tech stack for our future data science products
Apply machine learning techniques to large, complex datasets to better understand our customers and markets and drive innovation
Develop risk, AVMs, credit scores and decisioning models to aid the automation of our underwriting processes
Provide expertise on mathematical and statistical concepts and inspire the adoption of advanced analytics and data science across the entire breadth of our organisation
Support the development of analytic algorithms into production systems, writing production quality code and testing the production systems where applicable
Design, develop and maintain data science solutions for the business, which will be used internally and by our customers and partners.

Be a culture vulture. London is an incredible place – let’s make the most of it! Maybe you know the best spot for kebab, or maybe the West End is calling your name. We want to foster a culture where we’re serious about work and just as serious about having fun. Whether you’re a local expert or a brand new expat, be open to taking in what this city has to offer.

We host one of the largest repositories of publicly available data and enable our clients to significantly increase the amount of information they use to fuel solutions.

At ThinkData, our mission is to build the easiest and most secure solution that enables our users to access, integrate, and collaborate on the data that powers their business. Some of the largest companies in the world, from tech to banking and beyond, use our platform.

We’re not a single-solution AI company or a consulting firm disguised as a startup. We’re interested in solving the fundamental problem of accessing and distributing data. Namara, as a data management platform, will propel the next wave of intelligent solutions.

Need more reasons to join?

We may be technologically driven, but like every Canadian, we know the best ideas are thought of in a cottage outside of Toronto. During the summer, we take the whole team on a 3-day retreat for vision-setting, aligning our goals, product management, and team-building. We’re not saying this involves beers, guitars, and songs by the campfire. But we’re not saying it doesn’t.

We are managing our growth. We continue to promote and nurture the open, collaborative nature of who we are and how we work. We work hard while still having fun, being ourselves, hanging out together, and enjoying delicious snacks at the office.
